# Todo List

-Standard todo list

-Word itself suggest the user can make his todo things item list and he will be able to save, delete,edit the list whenever he wants.

-It was just a beginner level web application where the sole purpose of the application was to use the local storage of the browser.

-I access the local storage of the browser and saved the data in stringified form since it canâ€™t be stored in other forms and when user comes again to check I fetched the saved data, parsed it and served it to the user.
